- Install AusKey software
- Show file contents of `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin`
- Move .JAR files from `/Library/Java/Extensions` to `/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/lib/ext`

**UPDATE 16/11/2013:** AusKey no longer requires software to be installed on Mac OS X so these steps are no longer necessary
